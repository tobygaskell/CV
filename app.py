be in an environment where I am able to learn from others and contribute 
ideas. 

I specialise in ensuring engineering is completed efficiently to a 
high quality following industry standards. I pride myself on my collaboration 
skills including the ability to communicate effectively and understand 
requirements from both technical and non technical stakeholders. 

I relish the idea of working across a wide range of tools and technologies - 
as I have a thirst for all knowledge, especially widening my technical abilities. 

I am a competent programmer primarily in python with experience using other 
languages such as Java and R. I am driven, hardworking and excited by data.''')

of two normalised databases, two full python engines used to automatically 
run and update risk metrics using data from a vast number of different data 
sources held in snowflake.

As well as working with the business stakeholders to design, build and implement 
an interactive front end and work flow - which is used across multiple teams to 
input risk values and commentary.

I engineered a vast number of large machine generated security data sources 
which can ingest multiple billion rows a day. 

I had to consider solutions to batched, micro batched as well as streamed data 
sets from a variety of different sources - as well as complex unstructured data
sets which required custom solutions.

Team City.''')

the team via a messaging process when things went wrong. 

Figuring out how to dynamically identify what consisted a "normal" volume 
ingestion for each unique dataset was something i am especially proud of.
